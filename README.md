Demand Forecasting is one of the most crucial aspects in the supply chain
business to help the retailers in purchasing supplies at an economical cost with the
right quantity of product and placing orders at the right time. The present investigation
utilizes a yearsâ€™ worth of point-of-sale (POS) information to build a sales prediction
model, which predicts the changes in the sales for the following fortnight from the
sales of previous days. 

This research describes the existing and newly proposed
features for demand forecasting. 

The motivation behind this research to provide
novel features is to obtain an improved and intuitive demand forecasting model.
Two features proposed are: Item categorization using word2vec with clustering and
session of the day based on the time. 

The demand forecasting models with traditional
features like seasonality of goods, price points, etc. together with our proposed novel
features achieve better accuracy, in terms of lower RMSE, compared to demand
forecasting models with only traditional features.
